1. As an indecisive user, I want to view my past searches, so I can look back and compare my different options.
2. As an impatient person, I want to know how much traffic an activity brings, so that I donâ€™t have to wait for a long time before getting to do it.
3. As a picky eater, I want the option of filtering my search, so I can pick a restaurant that makes me happy.
